				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executives of public companies often receive a large part of their compensation in the form of company stock. This can be a great benefit as it aligns company performance with an executive’s goals. Therefore, the executive’s income has the potential to grow as she leads the company to success.</p>
<p>However, as part of their job, executives typically have access to “material nonpublic information” about the company. If they sell stock on the basis of this information, they would be guilty of violating federal, and possibly state, insider trading laws. Therefore, executives who receive compensation in the form of stock, stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), need to manage their share sales very carefully.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Securities Exchange Commission offers a solution — the 10b5-1 plan. If you are an executive or director of a public company, here’s what you need to know about setting up such a plan:</p>
<h2>What is a 10b5-1 plan?</h2>
<p>SEC Rule 10b5-1 defines the prohibition on insider trading. But it also provides an avenue to allow executives to trade shares of stock, and therefore diversify their holdings, without being accused of insider trading.</p>
<p>A 10b5-1 plan is a contract you file with the SEC that explicitly states you plan to sell company equity on a future date. It can be used for stock sales, stock option exercises, company repurchase programs, individual stock repurchase programs and restricted stock grant sales.</p>
<p>The plan must either detail the specific amount of stock, price and date; or it can be a formula, such as: “I plan to sell one-third of my available vested shares on the tenth trading day of the third quarter, as long as the price is above $10 a share.“ The instructions can specify either a market order or a limit order.</p>
<p>Plan details do not need to be made public. But company acknowledgment of the plan is required. And it may be in your best interest to have the company disclose that a plan exists in a Form 8-K.</p>
<h2>Do I need one?</h2>
<p>If you are a high-ranking company official or board director with access to material nonpublic information, then yes. Not establishing a 10b5-1 plan can present serious risks.</p>
<p>First, although your company may have its own insider trading policy, filing a 10b5-1 plan further protects you from suspicion if you should happen to sell shares before a major, detrimental event. </p>
<p>Take the case of four Equifax senior executives who sold company shares before the <a href="http://aspiriant.com/fathom/wealth-planning/cybersecurity-after-equifax/">enormous data theft</a> of nearly 148 million personal records was publicly announced last September. They were subject to an internal investigation, and according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-18/equifax-stock-sales-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, a federal investigation involving three of the officials was also launched. Bloomberg said, “Regulatory filings don’t show that the transactions were part of pre-scheduled trading plans.”</p>
<p>All four were eventually <a href="https://investor.equifax.com/news-and-events/news/2017/11-03-2017-124511096" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cleared by the Equifax Board of Directors</a>, which determined the executives had no prior knowledge of the breach before the sales, and the trades conformed with the company’s insider trading policy and had received preclearance by the firm’s compliance department. </p>
<p>The company’s report doesn’t say whether the executives had filed 10b5-1 plans beforehand, but they may have avoided serious investigations and bad publicity if they had.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if your investment portfolio has a high concentration of stock in the company you work for, it’s a good idea to gradually decrease your holdings as part of a detailed financial plan to diversify your portfolio and meet your financial goals. After all, most executives continue to earn significant amounts of deferred compensation in the form of equity grants. So selling shares on a regular, predetermined schedule makes sense. </p>
<h2>What other important things should I know about 10b5-1 plans?</h2>
<p>Most companies require that plans be established during open window periods. And some companies may impose a waiting period before transactions can take place.</p>
<p>The plan is good for one year. If you cancel it, you can’t file another one for a year. You’re on your own if you trade company stock.</p>
<p>A plan may be modified only if you do not have possession of inside information at the time of the change. It’s best to discuss any modifications with company counsel.</p>
<p>Depending on the company’s policy, you may be able to buy or sell stock during blackout periods.</p>
<p>Hedging of shares within the plan is not allowed.</p>
<h2>How do I set one up?</h2>
<p>Your wealth manager can help you determine the price levels and number of shares to benefit your financial goals and protect yourself from insider trading issues. They will then work with the custodian firm, which executes the plan.</p>
<p>Receiving company equity as part of your compensation has the potential to be very rewarding financially, but it requires understanding of the many securities rules. Partnering with a wealth manager who’s experienced with executive compensation and 10b5-1 plans allows you to stay focused on your work, diversify your portfolio and efficiently implement your financial plan — all with more peace of mind.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maximizing the impact of your legacy doesn’t happen accidentally. It takes a lot of hard work. Think about those who left the greatest legacies. Many spent the majority of their lives sharing their values and beliefs with others, sometimes at the expense of other facets of their lives. While we believe in a balanced life, we also think your legacy needs a place at the table. </p>
<p>First and foremost, give your legacy the attention it deserves. It’s going to be how people remember you, or perhaps whether they’ll remember you, 20 years from now. Will your great-grandchildren know the measure of the man or woman you were and how you helped to make them into the people they are today? Or will you be just another name on a family tree turned in as part of a high school report? What do you want it to be?</p>
<p>Here are six steps to help you leave a long-lasting effect on what matters to you most.</p>
<h2>1. Define it</h2>
<p>What is the legacy you wish to leave? To get started, read my previous fathom article, “<a href="http://aspiriant.com/fathom/wealth-planning/3-questions-define-legacy/">3 Questions to Define Your Legacy</a>.” Then try to narrow the focus down to one firm mission statement that carries you through all your endeavors. The mission statement should articulate your goals or philosophies in a short paragraph. It should be broad enough to encompass all you wish to accomplish, yet narrow enough to hone in on the areas you wish to impact.  </p>
<h2>2. Share it</h2>
<p>Don’t keep it a secret, be loud and proud. Let your family and friends know what you want your legacy to be. Tell them why you think the cause is important and why they should support you and your mission.</p>
<h2>3. Live it</h2>
<p>Leaving a meaningful legacy means living and breathing it every day. Your legacy is something you’re passionate about, and it should influence who you are and how you live your life daily. </p>
<h2>4. Support it </h2>
<p>The legacies we wish to leave must be supported. This support can come in several forms. The first is financial. For example, if you’re trying to help people live longer, healthier and more meaningful lives by being free of lung cancer, then monetary donations can support research, fund anti-smoking advertising campaigns and smoking cessation programs, and provide medical treatment for people living with the disease. </p>
<p>For those with the financial means, there are tools that can help facilitate the gifts to support your legacy and may also provide tax benefits. Some commonly used vehicles are donor advised funds, private foundations and charitable trusts.  </p>
<ul>
<li>A donor advised fund is like a charitable checking account. These funds allow the grantor (or gift giver) the opportunity to suggest gifts from the account to qualified 501c (3) charities. However, the donor advised fund’s custodian is not obligated to follow the donor’s requests for distribution to charities from the fund.
<li>A private foundation on the other hand, enables the donor to maintain greater control over the distribution of funds. This control lasts as long as the foundation is in existence, which may outlast the life of the donor. A good example is the $4.1 billion <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, which was established in 1913 and is currently run by a 13-member board of trustees.
<li>Charitable trusts provide the advantage of delaying the completion of the gift, thereby enabling the donor to derive an “income” stream from the assets during the donor’s lifetime. This approach works well when the donor needs to use the assets to support their living expenses. Upon the grantor’s death, the charitable gift will then be completed with the funds given to a qualified public charity.
</ul>
<p>These strategies also offer advantageous tax breaks, which ultimately means more money available to support the endeavor. However, when tax savings are not a concern, or if a donor wishes to give to organizations that are not qualified public charities, then discuss alternative methods with your wealth advisor.  </p>
<p>Giving your time is also very important, regardless of whether you have ample financial resources. There are so many ways to help and connect with people and impact their lives in a meaningful way: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lead — Serving on the board of directors of a non-profit or foundation, whether at a local, national or international level, can provide valuable insight to help further the organization’s mission and your legacy.
<li>Raise money — This can be done in a variety of ways, from signing up sponsors for a local charity race to organizing a fundraiser.
<li>Show up — Every organization needs the boots on the ground to help it run and grow. Those who lack the ability to make large financial donations can make significant contributions by spending time in the office or at activities.
<li>Advocate — Advocating for laws, rules or regulations can also have a major impact. For instance, asking for government funds for programs and research to treat lung cancer or pushing for regulations that ensure safety precautions for mine workers to reduce the incidents of black lung disease (cancer) can support your goal to help people live longer, healthier and more meaningful lives.
</ul>
<h2>5. Grow it</h2>
<p>Help others see the light and why they should support your mission. The most impactful legacies are left by those with a relentless drive to educate others about their values and beliefs. The passion you feel for your cause makes it easy for you to talk about it and encourage others to adopt it. </p>
<p>This is an opportunity to leverage your social network for good. In a networking model, each person attempts to bring on people to support the product, cause or organization. If you recruit 10 people, and those people each recruit 10 more, you’ll go from having one person supporting a cause to 111! This method of building organizations has proven to be successful for thousands of years.  </p>
<h2>6. Celebrate it</h2>
<p>While this might also fall under Share it and Grow it, it’s worthwhile to set aside time to assess and celebrate the legacy you seek to leave. What better way to raise awareness than to bring people together, affirm the core values and beliefs of your legacy, share your goals and progress toward those goals, and recruit their assistance. </p>
<p>Doing this will hold you accountable for your legacy, helping you focus on what you’re trying to accomplish. It is also a great way to bring together the people you love and care about to support a good cause. The gathering should be fun and done in such a way that people look forward to it! Celebrations can occur with any frequency you desire, and while anything more than annually may be too frequent, there’s no reason you couldn’t celebrate every second, third or fifth year. </p>
<p>As with anything we feel strongly about, maximizing the impact of your legacy takes careful consideration, planning and effort. Simply by reading this article, you’re probably thinking deeper about the legacy you wish to leave. And by following these six action steps, you’ll be well on your way to achieving it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to spring cleaning, the last thing you probably want to do right after tax season is organize your home office. But really this can be the best time to get your financial documents in order because they are likely close at hand. </p>
<p>Sometimes the question comes down to where to start. I would begin by gathering the most essential documents your wealth manager, and your family someday, would need to manage your financial affairs.</p>
<h2>5 essential financial documents</h2>
<p>It’s natural to put off organizing any important documents in your life because, well, it feels like adult homework. The exercise of thinking about where these documents are (or at least should be) can be stress-inducing and reason enough to put it off. But as with anything in life, it’s all about perspective.</p>
<p>Having the most important papers in one place comes in handy if you want to hire a new wealth manager, make changes to your financial plan, get a loan or update your estate documents. Doing the hard work now will save you time and stress later.</p>
<p>Here are the primary documents you should have at the ready for an early meeting with a financial professional:</p>
<p>1.  Last two years of tax returns<br />
2.  Most recent account statements (checking, savings, brokerage, mortgage or loans)<br />
3.  Up-to-date insurance declarations (home, auto, life)<br />
4.  All employment benefit documents<br />
5.  Estate planning and legal documents (wills, powers of attorney, advanced health-care directives, divorce settlements, prenuptial agreements, trusts, etc.)</p>
<p>If you don’t have current copies, take this opportunity to update your records. You typically can find most of this information online with your bank, broker-dealer, insurance company or employer. </p>
<p>Once you have copies of all these documents, stop, take a minute to open your favorite bottle of whatever it is you enjoy, and toast to your achievement. This has been an extraordinary effort already.</p>
<p>Ok, now that you’re done congratulating yourself, back to work. </p>
<h2>Get digital</h2>
<p>If you’re of that rare breed who has already stored these documents in a singular place, a fireproof safe let’s say, but you don’t have soft copies, then consider creating electronic versions. </p>
<p>It used to be that you had to travel to your local print-and-ship store to copy, scan or manipulate your professional documents. Today, you can use a home scanner or download one of several, cheap or free document scanning apps on your smartphone. Choose the method that’s easiest for you.</p>
<p>After scanning your documents, save them to a central drive. Most cloud services will allow you to store a set number of documents for free. If you’re at the point where you need to pay for storage, do it. This is the modern version of the fireproof safe, and once you full-heartedly adopt this technology, you’ll reap the benefits. Just be sure to create secure passwords and access the information via safe, secure networks.</p>
<p>Now that all these documents are in a central place, you can easily provide them to your professional advisors: wealth manager, estate planning attorney, accountant, etc. In addition, should your partner, family member, doctor or lawyer need to access them in the event of your incapacity, they are readily available, saving time and effort.  </p>
<h2>Share with family</h2>
<p>Naturally, you’ll want to share your accomplishment. This is the perfect time to ensure that the VIPs in your life know the location of important documents. Having these discussions ahead of an unforeseen event is an act of love that will really make difficult times a little easier. Be sure to provide your most trusted family members with your log-in information for essential accounts, as well as the names and phone numbers of professional advisors. </p>
<p>“My husband and I make time each year after tax season to review our latest balance sheet, shred old financial documents, and ensure we each have online access to our financial accounts,” shares my colleague <a href="http://aspiriant.com/our-exceptional-people-bios/mary-ellen-krueger/?c=principals">Mary Ellen Krueger</a>, director in investment advisory and a principal at Aspiriant. </p>
<p>Making this spring cleaning and organizing activity an annual practice will help to remind you to have these important conversations in case anything has changed or needs to be updated. </p>
<h2>Don’t agonize, organize</h2>
<p>With all your documents collected and centrally stored, you can approach a meeting with your financial planner or another professional service provider confidently. You’ll be able to easily provide them with the information necessary to give you the best advice. And you and your loved ones will have peace of mind knowing your financial documents are organized and readily available.  </p>
<p>As I mentioned at the start, it’s all about perspective. The half Saturday it takes to get organized will be well worth the investment of your time, ultimately saving you time and frustration later. Tie this exercise to a more immediate, tangible reward — perhaps a fancy dinner out, a nice night in or a refreshing spring walk, whatever’s your speed — to celebrate the accomplishment of being organized and prepared.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you go searching for wealth management services, you’ll typically face an “alphabet soup” of letters behind the name of each advisor you see. These letters provide important information about the individual’s qualifications and experience, but keeping them straight can be confusing. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s worth taking the time to understand them, because finding the right level and type of expertise will assure that you receive the optimal advice for your specific needs while avoiding frustrating mistakes and unnecessary costs. This begs the question: What designations should your advisor have to best support what you are trying to achieve with your wealth? </p>
<p>First and foremost, please note that all the designations referenced in this article are guided by a code of ethics and a <span class="asp-bold">“fiduciary”</span> standard of care. The fiduciary standard requires a financial adviser to act solely in the client’s best interest when offering personalized financial advice. A fiduciary must always put the client’s interest above their own. Consequently, a major benefit of selecting a professional advisor with one of these designations is that they are voluntarily committed to a higher standard of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Banks and broker-dealers, by contrast, are governed by a less demanding <span class="asp-bold">“suitability”</span> rule, which requires merely that any recommendation made to a client be suitable in terms of the client&#8217;s financial needs, objectives and circumstances. Under the suitability rule, the recommendation need not necessarily be the best available option for the client. For example, if an investment recommendation meets the suitability standard, the advisor is free to recommend a product that generates a larger commission than a similar product that might be more cost-effective for the client.</p>
<p>So, what is a professional designation, and what does it tell you? A professional designation is a standard established and maintained by a professional self-regulating body. The characteristics of a professional designation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A period of years working in the profession</li>
<li>Completion of a curriculum which defines the parameters of the profession</li>
<li>Passing a comprehensive examination on the curriculum content</li>
<li>Continuing education requirements</li>
<li>Adherence to a code of ethics</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to professional designations, many professionals complete master’s degree programs which give them a deeper level of knowledge in their area of specialization. These programs are usually offered by academic institutions and generally involve no further regulation once acquired. </p>
<p>What does this mean to you? It all depends on what service(s) you need. </p>
<h2>I need financial planning</h2>
<p>Imagine you are 60 years old and winding down your full-time working career as you approach retirement. You may be wondering if you have saved enough to comfortably support your retirement spending needs. You also must make a near-term decision regarding your employer’s pension plan in the form of a lump sum or lifetime income stream. Your oldest child just had her first baby, and you would like to help start a higher-education savings account for your new grandchild. A <a href="https://www.cfp.net/become-a-cfp-professional/cfp-certification-requirements" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Certified Financial Planner<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> (CFP<sup>®</sup>) can help you plan around all those things and much more. </p>
<p>The CFP designation is the premier professional certification mark for financial planners. The CFP must earn a college degree, complete a broad curriculum of study, satisfy a three-year work requirement and pass a rigorous exam before using the designation. The CFP curriculum includes goal setting and planning in the areas of investments, taxes, retirement, estates and trusts, insurance, and education. CFPs must meet continuing education requirements every two years to maintain their designation. </p>
<p>With this broad base of knowledge, CFPs can help you to see the big picture and to prioritize your efforts so that the most important issues are addressed first. CFPs often function as the “quarterback” of the financial advisory team, acting for many families like a chief financial officer or a sounding board, helping to coordinate all of their financial responsibilities. CFPs can also help avoid unintended consequences by considering how each area of your financial affairs affects all the others. </p>
<h2>I need tax planning and tax preparation</h2>
<p>As your net worth grows, your personal and business tax situations become more complex. More complexity can mean larger tax liabilities. However, it also can open the door for greater tax savings with advance tax planning. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://nasba.org/licensure/gettingacpalicense/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Certified Public Accountant</a> (CPA) can assist you with all your tax questions and planning. A CPA is authorized to advise, represent and prepare tax returns for individuals, partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts, and any entities with tax-reporting requirements. A CPA is a trusted advisor who must earn a college degree, pass a rigorous examination, meet a work experience requirement (generally one year), and take continuing professional education courses to maintain their CPA certification. Each state Board of Accountancy determines the specific requirements for those who wish to practice in their state, such as education, age, experience and other qualifications. The CPA exam covers four areas: audit, financial accounting and reporting, regulation, and business concepts. </p>
<p>While most people know CPAs are tax professionals, the designation was originally created to certify the accuracy and fairness of an entity’s financial condition. All publicly traded companies are required to have their financial statements certified by a CPA. Therefore, CPAs with audit work experience can be especially helpful to entrepreneurs and business owners because they are familiar with both the owners’ business and personal affairs, and can advise on a plan for them to best work together. </p>
<p>An alternative option for tax preparation is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/enrolled-agent-information" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enrolled Agent</a> (EA), a tax practitioner authorized by the Internal Revenue Service to prepare tax returns for individuals and entities and to represent clients before the agency. Unlike CPAs, with their broad collection of valuable knowledge, EAs are specifically qualified for tax preparation and representation only. EA’s must pass a series of three exams, but they are not required to meet an education or experience requirement. </p>
<h2>I need investment management</h2>
<p>The investment universe is a complex world of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s, and hundreds of other financial instruments. These instruments are available on different platforms and exchanges in countries and markets around the world. The prospect of managing a portfolio can be daunting for most investors, which is why most choose to hire a professional investment advisor. Investing requires a formidable level of discipline that prevents your emotions from interfering with your long-term investment strategy, which is where an objective advisor can be helpful. </p>
<p>Here are a few common designations you may encounter when seeking an investment advisor:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chartered Financial Analyst<sup>®</sup></a> (CFA) — The CFA has become the gold standard for investment knowledge. The required curriculum covers a broad range of topics related to investment management, financial analysis, stocks, bonds and derivative investments. There are three separate exams, six hours each. Once a candidate has passed all three exams, they must satisfy the four-year professional experience requirement to use the CFA marks. Many wealth management firms, like Aspiriant, employ CFA charter holders as the in-house experts regarding investment research and ongoing portfolio management.</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="https://investmentsandwealth.org/cima" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Certified Investment Management Analyst</a> (CIMA<sup>®</sup>) — This designation focuses on managing individual portfolio managers. The curriculum includes asset allocation, ethics, due diligence, risk measurement, investment policy and performance measurement. The CIMA training is less thorough than for the CFA, and the work experience requirement is three years.</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="https://caia.org/programs/the-caia-charter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst</a> (CAIA) — If you have a higher level of wealth, you may choose to add additional diversification to your portfolio through the use of alternative investments. Alternative investments encompass vehicles such as hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and commodities. They tend to be privately held (illiquid) and require high minimum investments. The attraction is the potential for greater returns than with traditional investments. However, their strategies are more complex and less regulated than traditional investments, requiring very specialized knowledge and experience. Fortunately, the CAIA designation was created to test for this specialized knowledge. Its curriculum requires a deep dive into the above investments with a rigorous two-part exam.</li>
<h2>I need estate planning and tax law expertise</h2>
<p>You and your spouse have finally decided to sit down and talk about your estate plan. Where to begin? </p>
<p>A knowledgeable estate planning attorney can review your current estate plan documents to ensure they meet your needs. They can also draft new documents that give you greater control over who may receive your assets and how the assets may be transferred. These professionals can help you avoid conflicts and delays in estate distribution while saving you estate and income taxes. Importantly, estate planning professionals can help avoid lawsuits and family squabbles regarding wealth transfer. </p>
<p>To become an estate planning attorney, one must earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree by graduating from an accredited law school and passing a rigorous examination in each state where they choose to practice. </p>
<p>Master of Laws (LL.M.) is a postgraduate academic degree that most commonly has a concentration in taxation. An attorney with an LL.M. in tax will have been exposed to a much wider body of tax knowledge than the ordinary J.D. An LL.M. can be essential when dealing with complex business transactions, business succession planning, unique and original structures to minimize estate and income tax, ownership of foreign assets, tax litigation and lesser known and highly specialized areas of the law.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</p>
<h2>
<p>The truth is that it generally takes a team to help you manage your wealth and achieve your goals. The more complex your wealth, the greater the need for those professionals to have the right education and experience. </p>
<p>Although designations cannot guarantee the right advice or the best performance, they are a measure of the minimum standards that your advisory team should meet and, therefore, are a good starting point to help you assemble your team with confidence. </p>
<p>At a minimum, the team should only include players who you can trust to act in your best interests. As mentioned above, every professional discussed in this article is bound by their designations to act in a fiduciary manner and put your best interests first.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right"><a href="http://aspiriant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Insight_2018Q1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="asp-bold">Print this Insight</span></a>.</p>
<p>Last quarter, we argued that skillful investors, like professional gamblers, generally come out ahead. One important reason is their ability to remain in the game, and ultimately, in the profession. A challenge to achieving that goal is staving off unnecessary risk-taking, especially following a prolonged winning streak.</p>
<p>This Insight builds on the discussion, identifying two of the most lethal risks afflicting investors today: equity exposure and margin. We further describe how two investing legends view each.</p>
<h2>Limited outs, then drawing dead</h2>
<p>A poker player is said to have “limited outs” when the odds of winning are heavily stacked against them. In that scenario, typically only a few cards remain in the deck that would help the player prevail. When the deck contains no more outs (useful cards), the player is said to be “drawing dead.” At that point, they have no chance of winning, regardless of what cards come up next. Since the player cannot see their opponents’ cards, they are typically in the unenviable position of being unaware that they are guaranteed to lose. So long as their opponent remains in the game, refusing to be bluffed into folding, the doomed player will face mounting losses, while their opponent rakes in the spoils.</p>
<p>As long-term investors, our primary goal is to remain in the game — giving ourselves as many opportunities to win as reasonably possible by intentionally avoiding extensive losses when drawing dead. To help us achieve that goal, we have developed forecasting and monitoring systems<sup>1</sup> designed to accurately assess changing probabilities. Like skilled poker players who reassess the odds every time a card is played, we recalibrate probabilities whenever new information is gained.<sup>2</sup> We are not trying to predict precisely what will happen in the near-term. To the contrary, we are simply trying to understand directionally how things will unfold over the next market cycle. Our process is akin to meticulously counting cards and recognizing and interpreting tells to grind out attractive long-term results.</p>
<img src="http://aspiriant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Figure-1.png" alt="" width="561" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8183" />
<p>Figure 1 presents one of the many ways we monitor changing levels of U.S. equity valuations. The analysis sorts and ranks the current and historical expensiveness of the S&#038;P 500 based on a valuation metric known as the Shiller PE.<sup>3</sup> This is one of our favorite metrics because it accounts for the ebbs and flows of a complete business cycle as well as the impact of inflation. As shown, the S&#038;P 500 is currently in the highest ventile (one-twentieth) group of expensiveness. In other words, it has been less expensive at least 95% of time. In fact, the S&#038;P 500 is more expensive now than preceding the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Indeed, the only time investors were willing to pay more for a fractional stake in the 500 companies was at the peak of the Technology, Media and Telecommunications bubble (TMT). Although there may still be some remaining outs, U.S. equities represent an obvious, unnecessary and avoidable risk, which is why we have been selling them into the strength of the market.</p>
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h2>The great flood (of liquidity)</h2>
<p>So how did equities get to this treacherous position? We have regularly complimented the G4 economies — the United States, Europe, Japan and England — for their swift, decisive and substantial response to the GFC. Things were bad, really bad: Economic growth was plummeting, millions of people were unemployed, and trillions of dollars of wealth were lost. But things would have gotten much worse were it not for the coordinated and sustained intervention by the central banks of these countries. Each dramatically lowered borrowing rates and launched extensive security purchasing programs, typically buying longer-dated government bonds.<sup>4</sup>  Collectively, these initiatives were designed to flood the economic and financial systems with liquidity. They worked swimmingly well.  Growth and employment have been buoyed, along with virtually all asset prices, especially those of global equities.</p>
<img src="http://aspiriant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Figure-2.png" alt="" width="561" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8183" />
<p>Figure 2 compares the aggregate balance sheets across the four central banks to the price level of global equities since the GFC. The banks’ securities purchases appear to have been a key factor in propelling and prolonging the rally in equities. The challenge going forward, however, is to understand how equities are likely to perform as the liquidity flood dissipates from the financial system. The Federal Reserve has already begun implementing plans to reduce its massive balance sheet. Other central banks, except for the Bank of Japan, have slowed the pace of buying activity and could very well cut their security holdings in the months ahead. Accordingly, we think it’s a near certainty that interest rates will rise, growth will turn sluggish, and equities will struggle as the process unfolds.</p>
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h2>The sucker in the room</h2>
<p>A professional investor (player) is highly unlikely to continue betting when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against them.<sup>5</sup> Rather, they are apt to sell expensive assets (fold) and preserve as much of their capital (bankroll) as possible. Investors (like players), who are unwilling or unable to properly assess risks (odds) in the marketplace (casino) are often referred to as the “sucker in the room.”<sup>6</sup> </p>
<p>Lacking skill, these investors tend to rely on their instincts, believing they will be well-served by doing so. However, their instincts tend not to be epiphanies. Rather, they are almost always related to one or more of the following basic and flawed investing strategies:<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">Performance Chasers</span><br />
This investor tends to “chase performance,” making investment decisions based on the recent past by increasing investments that have done well, while decreasing those that have done poorly. They believe markets are always efficient so current prices reflect all available information and accurately indicate future value. As such, they tend to have little concern over changing levels of risks. They consider investing to be a game of pure chance, with every investor equally likely to win or lose.</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">Speculators</span><br />
Any of the four types of investors may suffer from a fear of missing out, but speculators are most susceptible to this affliction. They tend to believe the unbelievable — that prices will continue to rise and become further detached from fair value. They look for reasons to justify why “this time it’s different.” Believing in the “greater fool theory,” they hope someone with less investment acumen will bail them out of their bad decisions. They may even become day traders, thinking they can outwit most people on most days. They tend to  hold individual stocks (or cryptocurrencies) that have been “hot.”</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">Market Timers</span><br />
Market timers generally have some broad notion that securities are overvalued or undervalued. They believe this information arms them with remarkable foresight to exit the market at or near its peak and return just as it has reached its bottom. In practice, however, they are rarely able to effectively execute their strategy, certainly not over multiple market cycles. As a result, they often find themselves grossly underinvested and realize returns that lag a passive benchmark over an extended period.</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">Day Dreamers</span><br />
These “bad students” frequently forget the lessons they should have learned throughout the course of their investing careers. They apply “revisionist history,” misremembering the devastating damage caused by expensive markets or wonderful opportunities created by inexpensive markets. As such, they experience recidivism — often paying a high price to relearn lessons.</p>
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h2>Learning from legends</h2>
<p>Still not convinced that skill is the key differentiator between pros and suckers? Still believe markets are always efficient and, therefore, successful investing simply requires being fully invested, with no need to manage risk? Ask yourself, how on earth is it possible that market bubbles and the ensuing crises occur much more frequently than should be statistically plausible?</p>
<p>Then, ask yourself two more questions:</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">Q1: How could anyone forecast future investment returns?</span><br />
In March 2000, Yale University professor Robert Shiller published a book, “Irrational Exuberance,”<sup>8</sup> in which he predicted the collapse of the TMT. Subsequent editions of the book predicted the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, as well as the GFC. In 2013, Shiller was honored as a co-recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for laying “the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices.” His work, including the development of the Shiller PE, was specifically noted for having &#8220;identified a variety of variables that forecast future stock returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Figure 3 displays the power<sup>9</sup> of the Shiller earnings yield to predict average annualized returns over the following 10 years. Clearly, Shiller’s approach has been a remarkably good predictor of future investment returns. Today, his framework suggests just a 2.5% average annualized return for the S&#038;P 500  over the next 10 years.</p>
<img src="http://aspiriant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Figure-3.png" alt="" width="561" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8183" />
<p>Our Capital Market Expectations (CMEs) follow a very similar framework. However, we forecast future returns for dozens of asset classes to construct globally diversified portfolios designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term.</p>
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<p><span class="asp-bold">Q2: Why would anyone hold cash?</span><br />
Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding a record $119 billion in cash and equivalents. In his 2017 annual shareholder letter, Chairman Warren Buffett reminded shareholders about the qualities he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger look for when making investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A business with durable competitive strengths</li>
<li>Skilled management</li>
<li>Attractive returns on operating assets</li>
<li>Opportunity for growth</li>
<li>A sensible purchase price</li>
</ul>
<p>
He went on to write, “That last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high.” </p>
<p>Accentuating his view on valuations, Buffett apparently doesn’t even find Berkshire Hathaway stock an attractive investment right now. He’s said he would consider using cash for share buybacks, but only up to a valuation level of 1.2 times book value. The stock currently trades at 1.5 times book value.</p>
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<hr />
</p>
<h3>Warren Buffet’s Investing Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.</li>
<li>Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.</li>
<li>Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.</li>
<li>What the wise do in the beginning, fools do in the end.</li>
<li>Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The dangerous lure of leverage</h2>
<p>While some industry legends believe equities are overvalued, others appear content to maintain, and even leverage, their exposure. As a reminder, leverage has the effect of amplifying a portfolio’s returns (making good returns better and bad returns worse).</p>
<p>Figure 4 displays the level of margin borrowing during the peak and trough of the TMT and GFC. In each of those instances, investors increased margin when valuations were high and then decreased margin when valuations were low. That’s the exact opposite of what a professional investor would recommend, but nevertheless it happened.</p>
<p>Today is no exception. Investors have borrowed approximately $600 billion to lever up their portfolios. Although that amount represents a seemingly low percentage of the $24 trillion<sup>10</sup> overall equity market capitalization, margin by any measure currently stands at an all-time high.</p>
<img src="http://aspiriant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Figure-4.png" alt="" width="561" height="417" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8183" />
<p>The chart also makes it quite clear that margin debt has grown dramatically over the years. A takeaway is that we seem to be migrating towards a society of aggressive risk takers as opposed to rigorous risk managers. What’s more disturbing is that our appetite for risk seems to grow at the precise time that it should wane. Unfortunately, like casinos, the investment industry has no shortage of junkets, hosts or shills<sup>11</sup> who are willing to extend the next marker,<sup>12</sup> even knowing the unskilled player is bound to lose.</p>
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h2>Paying the price</h2>
<p>Okay, so margin is at an all-time high. Now, if interest rates remained low and expected returns were high, we probably wouldn’t have any cause for concern. However, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, rates have already begun to rise<sup>13</sup> at the same time that forward-return expectations appear discouraging. Consequently, we believe it’s much more likely that margin will begin to amplify losses as opposed to gains. Investors taking these risks should be prepared to pay a potentially steep price if and when the market corrects.</p>
<img src="http://aspiriant.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Figure-5-6.png" alt="" width="800" height="592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8183" />
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h2>Play the hand you are dealt</h2>
<p>By artificially holding interest rates down over the past several years, central bankers engineered a landscape that was exceedingly receptive to risk-taking:  low and falling interest (discount) rates, marginal but stable inflation and growth, subdued market volatility, and negligible returns on cash and other safe assets. Risk takers, almost uniformly, have been handsomely rewarded. But as conditions evolve and drift away from that unusually fertile past, we expect materially different outcomes for investors. We believe the winners over the next several years will be those who preserve gains, protect capital and fortify a portfolio’s defensive positioning. Conversely, the suckers will continue to overextend themselves, press their luck with equities and margin, and eventually squander their outs and draw dead.</p>

<h4>Footnotes:</h4>
<p><span class="source"><sup>1</sup>We refer to our forecasting outputs as Capital Market Expectations (CMEs) and monitoring tools as financial EKGs.<br />
<sup>2</sup>We tend to focus our efforts on analyzing new information related to future cash flows and prevailing valuation levels.<br />
<sup>3</sup>The Shiller PE is calculated as the current market capitalization of the S&#038;P 500 divided by the average, inflation-adjusted earnings of the companies over the trailing 10 years.<br />
<sup>4</sup>Quantitative Easing (QE) has been implemented differently across countries. It usually entails the purchase of government and federally sponsored or backed agency debt but can also include the purchase of other securities.<br />
<sup>5</sup>An exception in poker is a player may try to bluff their opponent into folding a superior hand.<br />
<sup>6</sup>The aphorism has been used to describe gambling and investing going back to at least the early 1970s. Warren Buffett used a variant in his 1987 annual shareholder letter.<br />
<sup>7</sup>Any of the four strategies often confuse the strength of the economy with the strength of financial markets.<br />
<sup>8</sup>The book’s title is credited to a quote by Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time.<br />
<sup>9</sup>Among others, Professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania has argued that changing accounting standards over the years resulted in lower reported earnings and, therefore, higher price-to-earnings ratios. We find merit on the impact for the average level of valuations over time, but our process is most concerned with outlier valuations at the extremes.<br />
<sup>10</sup>As of December 29, 2017.<br />
<sup>11</sup>Junkets are independent promoters who bring gamblers to casinos in exchange for a portion of the amount gambled. Hosts are similar to junkets, but are typically employed by one casino. Shills accompany high-stakes gamblers, typically signing markers to provide anonymity to the gambler.<br />
<sup>12</sup>A marker is a signed slip of paper representing an agreement for a casino to extend credit (more chips) in exchange for the gamblers’ promise to repay the marker with interest.<br />
<sup>13</sup>For example, the Federal Reserve has enacted five quarter-point increases to the federal funds rate over the past nine quarters, taking the target rate from 25 bps – 50 bps to 150 bps – 175 bps.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though it wasn’t the complete estate tax repeal that some had promised, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will still have a significant impact on tax planning going forward. </p>
<p>The tax law passed in late 2017 effectively doubled the amount that a taxpayer can transfer without gift, estate or generation-skipping transfer (GST) taxes, up to $11.18 million per individual or $22.36 million per couple, beginning this year. The tax rate on transfers above that amount remains at 40%. But, without some future agreement by Congress, these changes expire in just eight years, and the exemption amount will revert to $5 million per person, adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>These changes in the tax law will influence taxpayers of all sizes, but the interplay of this legislation with existing tax laws in these areas complicates a taxpayer’s options:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="asp-bold">Step-up in basis</span> &#8212; Congress continues to allow a full step-up in income tax basis to fair market value for most assets included in the estate — even if the estate is under the exemption so no estate tax is due — potentially reducing future income taxes heirs could be required to pay if they sold the assets. However, to get the step-up in basis, the assets cannot have been gifted outright or in trust prior to death or be held in a bypass trust created from a living trust at the surviving spouse’s death.</li>
<li><span class="asp-bold">Portability of a spouse’s exemption</span> &#8212; In 2012, Congress made permanent the portability of a spouse’s estate tax exemption, meaning that a surviving spouse can use the unused exemption of a deceased spouse at death. This change reduced the need for a bypass trust in a taxpayer’s living trust.</li>
<li><span class="asp-bold">Portability of GST exemption</span> &#8212; Congress did not make a taxpayer’s GST tax exemption similarly portable for assets held in trust over multiple generations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, you should review your estate plan to determine if changes are needed regardless of the size of your estate. If your estate is under $11 million, you may be able to make changes to reduce complexity and save income taxes after you pass away. If your estate is between $11 million and $22 million, you may want to make taxable gifts to take advantage of the increased exemption, but you must balance the benefits of lifetime gifting with your own future personal spending needs and the loss of the step-up in basis on those gifted assets. If your estate is more significant, you will likely benefit from taking steps to fully use the increased exemption, although several different options exist for taking advantage of the increase. </p>
<h2>6 immediate considerations</h2>
<p>You should meet with your financial advisor and estate planning attorney to discuss:</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">1. Your existing estate plans</span><br />
If your estate is not likely to be subject to estate tax — meaning your net estate is likely to be below your remaining exemption at death — and you previously transferred assets into irrevocable trusts for your heirs, you should consider whether to make any adjustments to that strategy. For example, if the trusts are grantor trusts, you might consider exchanging trust assets with a low-income tax basis with higher-basis assets you hold personally. This would allow those low-basis assets to receive a step-up to fair market value basis at your death, thereby reducing the income taxes on those assets when you pass away. Separately, you might decide to turn off the grantor trust nature of those trusts so that you no longer pay the income taxes of the trust. Additionally, you might decide to discontinue any annual gifting plan to the trusts. Again, you will want to discuss these options with your advisors since some of them may not be appropriate, especially if your estate would still be taxable if the estate tax exemption increase expires after 2025.</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">2. Continuing estate tax planning</span><br />
If you would have a taxable estate if the estate tax exemption increase expires after 2025 (meaning a single person with a net worth more than $6 million or a couple with more than $12 million), it’s important to continue estate tax planning, regardless of this new tax law. While the increased estate tax exemption might keep you free from estate tax today, the only way you can fully utilize it before your death is by giving away all of your assets before the increase expires. </p>
<p>For example, if you are single and your net worth is $9 million, you have no estate tax today. But if the exemption reverts to $6 million after 2025 (factoring in inflation), you would still have $1.2 million in estate tax at death (40% of $3 million). Given your own financial needs, you likely are not able to use the increased exemption (which applies during life and at death) by gifting away $9 million. Even if you were comfortable giving away $6 million in assets today, after 2025 your estate would still be $3 million, and you would have used up your $6 million exemption with the taxable gift. As a result, your estate tax at death after 2025 would still be $1.2 million. But, because you would have gifted the $6 million out of your estate during your life, your heirs would lose the step-up in basis at death to fair market value on the assets and ultimately be in a worse tax situation. </p>
<p>Instead, if you continued to use estate tax techniques to transfer $3 million of your estate to your heirs without using the gift-tax exemption, your remaining estate would pass estate tax-free under your exemption at death, and all $6 million in assets would receive a full step-up in basis. </p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">3. Removing an automatic bypass trust</span><br />
The automatic bypass trust was universally added to living trusts before 2012, but it now adds unwanted complexity after the first spouse dies and could cause heirs to incur significant and unnecessary income taxes after both spouses pass. For married couples, unless the net value of your estate is over $20 million, you likely should not have an automatic bypass trust. </p>
<p>In many cases, the assets of the first spouse to pass away should instead be distributed to a marital trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse. This will allow full use of both spouses’ GST tax exemption since that exemption is not portable. To add flexibility in case of future tax law changes, the surviving spouse could be given the discretion at the first death to “disclaim” assets (i.e., give up the right to have the assets pass to the marital trust) and instead have the assets go into a bypass trust if needed. Some exceptions exist where such a plan is not appropriate, but those can be discussed with your advisors.</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">4. Gifting the increased exemption to grantor trusts</span><br />
For very large estates, where the taxpayer has the financial ability to gift away the increased exemption amount during life, we would recommend the taxpayer go ahead and give it away if it appears the exemption will revert to $5 million per person. However, as those gifted assets will not receive a step-up in basis at the taxpayer’s death, ideally only non-appreciated assets would be gifted. We typically would recommend that those assets be gifted to new or existing grantor trusts so that any future income tax associated with those assets remains with the taxpayer. This serves as a way for the taxpayer to make annual tax-free gifts of the income tax imposed on those assets. Gifting to grantor trusts might also allow the grantor to exchange low-basis trust assets for higher-basis personal assets in the future, as mentioned above. The best plan would be to leverage the increased exemption by combining these gifts with other estate tax strategies to more substantially reduce the estate. </p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">5. Spousal access trusts</span><br />
For married couples who would be uncomfortable giving away complete access to $22 million in assets, another option would be to have one spouse set up an irrevocable trust that benefits the other spouse and make gifts into that trust. </p>
<p>For example, Spouse A would set up an irrevocable trust for the lifetime benefit of Spouse B that passes to their children at Spouse B’s death. Spouse A would gift $11 million into the trust, fully utilizing Spouse A’s current increased exemption. If Spouse B did not need those funds during their life, the assets could grow and pass estate tax-free at Spouse B’s death. Spouse B would retain their own exemption (which may have gone down to $6 million at this point) to offset some of the estate tax due at his death. While this allows the couple to make tax-free transfers of as much as $17 million and for Spouse B to retain access during life, Spouse A cannot be a beneficiary of this irrevocable trust and, therefore, loses access to the funds if they outlive Spouse B. Additionally, this strategy only utilizes one spouse’s increased exemption. </p>
<p>To fully utilize both exemptions, Spouse B could also set up a non-identical trust that provides access to Spouse A, although this would not solve the access issue since the couple would lose access to one of the trusts at the first death. While this strategy may not be appropriate for all clients and does add complexity, it is an option to consider with your advisors.</p>
<p><span class="asp-bold">6. Timing your gifting</span><br />
If you have decided to make lifetime gifts to use up the increased exemption, there is no push to make those gifts until there is a clear indication that the estate tax exemption is set to decrease. Because the gifted assets will no longer receive a step-up in basis upon the taxpayer’s death, it might actually be detrimental to do lifetime gifting if the taxpayer were to pass away while the increased exemption is still in place. </p>
<p>While the increased exemption is set to revert in 2026, Congress could change these tax laws before then. Given the current political situation, the tax laws could possibly be revised after the next presidential election with the exemption reduced to even less than $6 million. However, we feel it is highly unlikely that the current administration would allow the new law to be undone, so a taxpayer should have at least three years to determine if they want to gift and when. Still, if you will have a taxable estate even with the increased exemption, and you plan to use the increase as part of some leveraged estate tax strategy, there is no reason to wait.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In sum, while the doubling of the estate tax exemption is generally beneficial, you should revisit your estate plans with your advisors. There are still many considerations that should be reviewed by taxpayers at all levels of net worth to maximize the benefits of this new tax law.   </p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the April 17 tax filing deadline fast approaches, we find ourselves rushing to finish our 2017 income tax returns while strategizing around the new <a href="http://aspiriant.com/fathom/wealth-planning/tax-cuts-jobs-act/">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, which takes effect for tax year 2018. As a result, it’s easy to be misled by tax myths and misconceptions. Below, several of our wealth management experts have set out to debunk some of the more common myths regarding income and estate taxes to help you save time and money.</p>
<h2>Myth 1: You need to spend a lot of time and energy documenting your itemized deductions</h2>
<p>A common misconception is that taxpayers need to provide a lot of detail to their accountants about their itemized deductions. The most time-consuming records to organize are for Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions. These include tax preparer fees, investment fees, unreimbursed job expenses (including unreimbursed travel, dues and subscriptions), and safe deposit box rental, to name only a few. For 2017, if you were subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), these deductions were disallowed rendering your upfront preparation worthless in the end. Under the new tax law, it gets worse. These expenses are now disallowed for everyone, not just for those subject to AMT.</p>
<p>We recommend speaking with your wealth manager or personal tax preparer now about what allowable deductions remain and if there are other strategies for deducting these costs. As the new tax law resulted in significant changes in this regard, it may save you disappointment when you review your 2018 tax return and find all your hard work on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>— <a href="http://aspiriant.com/our-exceptional-people-bios/michael-v-glowacki/?c=principals">Michael Glowacki</a>, Director in Wealth Management, Principal</p>
<h2>Myth 2: It doesn’t cost anything when you gift appreciated securities to a charitable organization or donor advised fund</h2>
<p>The benefits of charitable giving with appreciated stock are considerable. Before you make plans to do so, we recommend that you make sure you have the charitable intent necessary to make such a gift. In the appropriate situation, the true “cost” to you may be as little as 19¢ for every $1 gifted, but it’s not zero. </p>
<p>For example, if you bought 63 shares of Amazon stock in 2010 for $7,000 and subsequently gifted those shares to a charity in 2018, you would be forgoing the chance to sell those same shares for proceeds of $100,000. In California, you could avoid state and federal taxes in the amount of $31,000 on that sell transaction (33% x long-term capital gain of $93,000). You also would receive a charitable deduction based on the $100,000 fair market value at time of donation, which if you had sufficient other income could give you a tax deduction worth as much as $50,000. Therefore, your net after-tax cost of the gift is $19,000. The key is making the charitable gifts in high-income years when you can get the most “bang for your buck” on the charitable deduction. </p>
<p>— <a href="http://aspiriant.com/our-exceptional-people-bios/clay-r-stevens/?c=principals">Clay Stevens</a>, Director in Strategic Planning, Principal</p>
<h2>Myth 3: Pay off your home mortgage or home equity line of credit if you have the means</h2>
<p>Most homeowners have the ultimate goal of paying off their home loan, whether it be for emotional reasons or simply to improve their monthly cash flow position. However, keeping existing loan balances (mortgages and home equity lines) in place could make sense for overall <a href="http://aspiriant.com/fathom/wealth-planning/optimizing-mortgage-new-tax-law/">tax and investment optimization</a>. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the deduction for interest payments to the first $750,000 of mortgage debt used to purchase or substantially improve a principal residence or vacation home, combined. And for existing mortgages, the law grandfathered up to $1 million in debt.</p>
<p>Because of the dramatic changes to allowable itemized deductions noted above, many taxpayers are scrambling to find qualified expenses to deduct. To that end, if your mortgage interest and other deductions exceed the standard deduction amount, it may make sense to keep the liability in place and continue to deduct the interest on Schedule A. And even though home equity interest is generally no longer deductible, if the interest cost is low, you might earn a greater return by maintaining your investments instead of paying down a home equity loan.</p>
<p>For higher-cost debt, ask your wealth manager to figure the after-tax cost of the debt and compare that cost to investment opportunities elsewhere to determine if or when to pay down a loan.</p>
<p>— <a href="http://aspiriant.com/our-exceptional-people-bios/tom-tracy/?c=principals">Tom Tracy</a>, Chief Client Officer, Principal</p>
<h2>Myth 4: Pay your next years’ state quarterly estimated income tax in December</h2>
<p>You now cannot deduct more than $10,000 of the combined total of your state and local income taxes and your local property taxes on your personal federal income tax return (or sales tax plus property taxes in states where there is no income tax). If you have high state income and real estate taxes, you will likely be losing out on the deductibility of any dollars over and above $10,000 going forward. For this very reason, paying state estimated tax early in December (rather than January) does not provide you with any benefit. Keep the money in the bank or invested a little longer. </p>
<p>— Mark Cecchini, Senior Associate in Wealth Management</p>
<h2>Myth 5: Leave California to avoid taxes</h2>
<p>California certainly has one of the highest state income tax rates, which is now even more burdensome with the loss of the federal deduction for state income taxes. Some residents, therefore, are leaving the Golden State for other states where there is little or no state income tax, like Nevada, Oregon and Washington. However, unlike Oregon, Washington and 19 other states, California does not have a state inheritance tax, which can be as high as 20% and imposed on all your assets — not just the income earned from those assets. </p>
<p>For example, if a Californian with a net worth of $20 million and $1 million in taxable income moves to Washington to take advantage of the 0% state income tax rate, they may save $130,000 a year in state income taxes, but they could pay over $3.5 million in state inheritance taxes at death. </p>
<p>So, it makes sense to have your wealth manager weigh your income versus estate tax liabilities before you move. One of our clients just relocated to California to save taxes — and the warmer weather was just a bonus!</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Reconsidering Small Business Compensation</h2>
<p>The new qualified business income (QBI) deduction provides a new reason for small business owners to reconsider how they distribute profits to themselves. Additionally, entrepreneurial-minded employees may find this tax incentive compelling enough to form their own company and serve as an independent contractor.  </p>
<p>Generally, this deduction created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act can be as much as 20% of the net income reported by the owners of a qualified business. Keeping in mind that the greater the reported net income, the larger the tax benefit, owners of profitable businesses will want to maximize this deduction.</p>
<p>Maximizing the value of the <a href="http://aspiriant.com/fathom/wealth-planning/understanding-new-qualified-business-income-deduction/" target="_self">QBI deduction</a> comes down to two questions: What structure is your business? And how are you compensated?</p>
<h2>Business Structure</h2>
<p>Historically, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/forming-a-corporation" target="_blank">C corporations</a> have been the default limited liability choice for businesses with multiple owners. A chief downside with this structure, however, has been that income is taxed twice — first the business is taxed on its net income, then the shareholders are taxed when those profits are paid out as dividends. A new downside is that the QBI deduction is not even available to C corporation owners.
</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">S corporation</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To address both problems, C corporation owners should consider making an election to be treated as an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations" target="_blank">S corporation</a>, which is essentially a flow-through vehicle with partnership-like characteristics. This election will eliminate the dual-tax nature of the business and allow its owners to benefit from the QBI deduction.</p>
<p>Be aware that, unlike partnerships and disregarded entities, S corporation shareholders are not subject to self-employment taxes on their share of business income. Therefore, the IRS has the ability to recharacterize S corporation distributions as “reasonable compensation” for an owner’s services to the business, which does not qualify for the QBI deduction.  </p>
<h2>Owner Compensation</h2>
<p>Compensation reported on a W-2 is already the most severely taxed form of income a taxpayer can report. A business owner who receives this type of compensation, or guaranteed payments for services rendered to a partnership, suffers further cost as it is not eligible for the QBI deduction.
</p>
<p>Additionally, each dollar of an owner’s W-2 compensation reduces the net QBI of the business by the same amount. Since the QBI deduction is 20% of net QBI, the higher your marginal tax bracket, the costlier the impact of a reduced QBI deduction.</p>
<p>Thus, it will be less expensive for an owner to withdraw cash from non-C corporation businesses as distributions, rather than as taxable compensation. </p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Because of these specific tax savings for pass-through income, if you’re an employee, you may want to explore starting your own company and contracting your services to your current employer in order to convert W-2 earnings into partnership or sole-proprietorship income. But keep in mind that if you make above $157,000 a year as an individual or $315,000 married filing jointly, the QBI deduction is limited, and may be eliminated completely, for certain service trades such as accounting, consulting and legal services. See my earlier fathom article, <a href="http://aspiriant.com/fathom/wealth-planning/understanding-new-qualified-business-income-deduction/" target="_self">Understanding the New Qualified Business Income Deduction</a>, for more information.</p>
